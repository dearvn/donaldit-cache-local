Caching is a method of storing locally a web page or web resource so that it can be accessed more quickly. It is a feature of web browsers and other web technologies that enables faster loading of webpages and resources. When a web browser caches a page, it stores the HTML, CSS, JavaScript, images and other resources of the page in its local memory, which allows the website to be loaded quickly when revisited. By caching locally, the browser will not have to download the same content over and over again, saving time and bandwidth. Additionally, this allows webpages to load more quickly and efficiently, making them more user-friendly. Caching is an important part of web development and an essential tool in creating a better user experience.
